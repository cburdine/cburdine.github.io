Welcome to my blog! Here I will do my best to give occasional expositions on topics that I find interesting, profound, or meaningful. I'm not sure what kind of trajectory this blog will take, but my goal is that these posts will each serve as self-contained tutorials that provide a deep-dive into a technical topic that I find to be either relevant to my area of research or interesting in its own right. In these posts, I will do my best to make the content accessible to readers with a technical background, while not providing redundant information that would otherwise be a Google search away.

I am not sure yet if I have the time (or self-discipline) to maintain a regular upload schedule. Ideally, I am aiming to upload at least one post per month. Below are some of the topics (in no particular order) that I am thinking of posting on in the coming months:

* Undecidable Problems (Computer Science / Mathematics)
* Kolmogorov Complexity (Computer Science / Mathematics)
* Transfinite Induction (Mathematics)
* An Introduction to Machine Learning (Computer Science / Statistics)
* An Introduction to Quantum Computing (Physics / Statistics)
* Some interesting results from Graph Theory (Mathematics)
* Cryptocurrency and *The Bitcoin Standard* (Computer Science / Finance)
* An Introduction to Group Theory and Symmetry (Mathematics / Physics)
* ... (and some other topics, provided that I make it this far)

As I upload and document more of my personal projects on this site, I may also write a few blog posts detailing my progress on those. I will do my best to keep things sorted under different tags to avoid this blog becoming a spaghettified repository of information.
