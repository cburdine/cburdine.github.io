Hi, I'm Colin, a graduate student at Baylor University in the electrical and computer engineering department. I come from a computer science and mathematics background, but my academic research cuts across many disciplines, ranging from nano-scale computing technologies to machine learning and quantum information.

Research
======
[Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law) has predicted that the number of transistors on integrated circuits has roughly doubled every two years since the 1970s. However, it is widely believed that this exponential trend in device density is unsustainable, as semiconductor-based transistors must contend with adverse quantum mechanical effects at the nanometer scale. In my research, I am investigating an alternative paradigm of computing: molecular quantum cellular automata (QCA). Unlike semiconductor-based devices, which perform computation through the flow of charge-carrying particles, molecular QCA does computation through the reversible displacement of charge in molecules. It is believed that molecular QCA-based devices may provide a low-power high-speed alternative to the semiconductor-based devices of today.

I am currently working in [Dr. E. P. Blair's](http://web.ecs.baylor.edu/faculty/blair/) Lab in the Electrical and Computer Engineering departmentat Baylor University. I have had previous summer appointments at Sandia National Lab (2020) and Argonne National Lab (2021) through the [U.S. Department of Energy SULI program](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli).

I have also contributed to the [SAGE](https://sagecontinuum.org/) project, which seeks to develop infrastructure for AI/ML applications on edge devices. In particular, I have contributed to the [Waggle Sensor Project](https://github.com/waggle-sensor) project, which is an open source platform for developing intelligent sensor networks.

Materials + ML Course

I am in the process of developing an open-source introductory workshop course in Machine Learning and its applications in Materials Science. I lead the first iteration of this workshop at Bayloy University in Summer 2023, and plan to continue revising and expanding the online content for the course. All course materials including lecture slides, recordings, Python code, etc. are available [here](https://cburdine.github.io/materials-ml-workshop) for free.

About this Website
------
My aim in creating this site is a have place to document some of my projects, both academic and non-academic. I am also hoping to upload the occasional blog post, which may cover topics within and adjacent to my research interests.
